Pair match card game.

You need to make it in MVC and not use any AI to write code. 
Can use it to figure out things like logic or syntax.

- Make a board with x*x cards (must be an even number for pairing. 
  Using at least one even number when selecting board size should prevent this)
- Each card is face-down, and flips when revealed (preferably with an animation, 
  then a green/red background/border/overlay on the card)
- There should always be two of each card. No rules against multiple though
- Track the game state at all times.

- Only two cards should be in a "flipped"-state at one time (unless cleared).
- If they're equal, let them stay flipped or some other solution.
- If not equal, flip them back face-down (Maybe play an "wrong" sound effect)

- When all cards are cleared, the player wins and you get to see how many moves have been executed
- Make the player able to hit "retry" after finishing their game.
- Show how few moves you're able to do, what "par" would be and how "low" would be. 
  Basically giving the player a rank from I (Impossible), SS (perfect), 
  S (Great), A (Good), B (Decent), C (Bad) and finally D (Horrible) tier
  
The UI should be simple and straightforward, but using *some* styling to make it look... well, not 80s style.
A secondary objective could be to physically draw the UI. Is it a good idea? Hell yeah

Potential additional features could be this:
Endless mode:
Includes powerups, things you can buy to improve your run in endless mode. Suggestions:
- Permaflip two cards
- Tempoarily reveal all cards at the start of the round for 2 seconds
- Grants a shield that prevents your rank from decreasing ONCE. Upgrade every 3 rounds.




Development process:

User interaction process would go like this:
User loads the page -> Splash/welcome screen appears (Menu, title etc.)
-> Menu interactions like difficulty (with custom) and settings
-> Load the cards, start timer -> state=select, Check for user input -> Recieve input ->
-> Check card parameters -> state=flipping, Approve/deny the transaction
-> Flip/don't flip cards -> state=select, return control to the player
-> State=menu, Board empty


Create the fundamental file and folder structure required for MVC and
Create all the potentially necessary files:
- Core (Connects everything together and kicks things into function)
	Trackers like stats and rank is processed here
- Menu (Contains all menu logic and options frontend)
- Mode (Contains easy, medium, hard, insane and custom modes)
- Cards (Contains all the references to card front images that you can match)
- Items (Items for the endless mode)
- Graphics (Simple JS graphics or handcrafted drawings BY MEEEEEEE)
